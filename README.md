# Afros Blog

This is a classic "News Paper" styled theme. I created this as a remembrance of eye friendly UI/UX design when print was "King" - solely focused on information sharing and the purity of being human. "Our essence of being in open and being the source, lest they source us out".

## Features
1. Mobile Responsive, on all major devices and modern web browsers
2. Light & Dark Mode, takes advantage of browser "localStorage function"

## Future Features to be Added
I also plan on creating a full WordPress Theme from this theme by end of 2021,
which will feature the following:
1. Pagination
2. Ad spaces
3. Video & Audio support from - YouTube, Vimeo and Sound Cloud
4. Contact form/s
5. Google Maps
6. Woocommerce support for paid subscriptions
