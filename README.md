# News Paper Theme

This is a classic "News Paper" styled theme. The theme was created to reimagine a simple eye friendly look and feel solely focused on the information being shared.

## Features
1. Mobile Responsive, on all major devices and modern web browsers
2. Light & Dark Mode, takes advantage of browser "localStorage function"

## Future Features to be Added
I also plan on creating a full WordPress Theme from this theme by end of 2021,
which will feature the following:
1. Pagination
2. Ad spaces
3. Video & Audio support from - YouTube, Vimeo and Sound Cloud
4. Contact form/s
5. Google Maps
6. Woocommerce support for paid subscriptions
